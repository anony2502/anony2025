This is the replication package of our work: **TestUpdater**.

* `TestUpdater/` contains the implementation of our approach.
* `Updates4J/` is used to construct the **Updates4J** dataset.

You can refer to the specific README files under `TestUpdater/` and `Updates4J/` for more details.

The `environment.yml` file lists the dependencies we used. You can create a new Conda environment with the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually based on the listed packages and versions.

For instructions on how to reproduce the experiments, please refer to `TestUpdater/README.md`.
