system_prompt_1 = """
You are a Java expert skilled in maintaining and updating unit tests to reflect changes in a focal method. \
Your goal is to analyze the changes between the original and updated focal methods and provide only the minimal information needed to repair and update the original test method effectively.

### Context:
The information you provide will be used to fetch details about specific methods and classes, which will then be used to update the unit test. Precision in identifying only the essential elements is critical.

### General Guidelines:
- Focus on changes that directly impact the test method.
- Identify new functionality, new parameters, or obsolete test logic that needs to be repaired.
- Ensure the test remains functional and relevant to the updated focal method.
"""

prompt_1_0 = """
Original Test Method:
```java
{TEST_SRC}
```
Changes in Focal Method:
```java
{FOCAL_DIFF}
```

### Your Task:
1. Analyze the differences between the original and updated focal methods.
2. Determine the minimal set of methods and classes whose details are necessary to update the original test method based on these changes. Consider:
    - New functionality that requires additional test cases.
    - New parameters that may need mocks or default values.
    - Obsolete test logic that needs to be repaired when functionality remains unchanged.
3. Return your analysis in JSON format with the following structure:
    ```json
    {{
      "method": ["method_name1", "method_name2", ...],
      "class": ["class_name1", "class_name2", ...]
    }}
    ```
    - **"method"**: A list of up to 5 method names whose details are essential for updating the test.
    - **"class"**: A list of up to 5 class names whose details are required for updating the test.

### Instructions:
- Include only the essential methods and classes needed for the test update.
- If fewer than 5 methods or classes are sufficient, list only those.
- Ensure the JSON output is correctly formatted and contains only the requested information.
- Do not include extraneous analysis, descriptions, or unrelated code elements.

### Example:
If the updated focal method adds a parameter of type UserService, you might include "class": ["UserService"] to understand how to mock or initialize it in the test.

Below are the definitions of the methods and classes you requested, along with some additional references:

{CONTEXT}

### Your Task
Please refine the provided information by **removing irrelevant details** and keeping only what is necessary to update the test method.

### Instructions:
1. **methods**:
   - If a method is needed, **keep its entire definition**.
   - If a method is not relevant, **remove it completely**.
2. **Classes**:
   - Keep **only** the necessary **variables and methods** from class definitions.
   - Remove any irrelevant attributes, methods, or comments.

### Response Format:
- Retain all statements outside of Java code.
- Respond without further explanations or comments.

You are a Java expert tasked with updating a unit test based on changes to a focal method.

### Instructions:
1. **Update the Original Test Method**:
   - Modify the test method to align with changes in the focal method, using the provided context.
   - Ensure the test remains functional and correctly tests the updated behavior of the focal method.
   - Add new test cases if the focal method includes new functionality.
   - Handle any new parameters by adding mocks (e.g., using Mockito) or default values (e.g., null, true/false, "") as needed.
   - Fix any outdated logic in the test if the focal method's core functionality remains unchanged.

2. **Manage Import Statements**:
   - Add import statements only for new classes or methods introduced in the updated test method.
   - Do not add imports for classes or methods already present in the original test method.
   - Place all new import statements at the top of your response, before the updated test method.

Details of methods and classes extracted from the code, necessary for updating the test method, along with some additional references:

Please update the test method based on the information above.

**Response Format**:
- Begin with any new import statements (if applicable).
- Follow with the updated test method, fully formatted as valid Java code.
- Respond with import statements and updated test methods only (not the full test class, just the methods).

### Example Response:
```java
// New import statements

import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

// Updated test methods
@Test
public void testFocalMethod() {{
    // Updated test logic here

Fail to compile your response's test code automatically.

This time, do not mock or add new tests for changes in the focal method.
Just perform the least modifications to repair the original test method.

- An example of the least modifications:
In the case of a new parameter in the focal method, use default value such as null, true, false, "", any() and so on.
The original statement in test code:
type value = focal_method(parameter0, parameter1)
The updated statement in test code:
type value = focal_method(parameter0, parameter1, "")
